- add a stickies-like note that welcomes users to my portfolio.
- add a 1-second mock login screen at the start (and maybe a welcome message?) with my name & face.

keep search-bar functionality in mind when implementing everything below:

- recreate either preview or something else for viewing resume, education background, projects (start with dummy projects) and tech stack -- interlink tech stack and projects.
- figure out a way to dynamically generate the data for "projects" component - pull info/data from my GitHub repos to automate this maybe. BONUS; figure out a way to dynamically fetch/generate appropriate mac-style icons for each project.
