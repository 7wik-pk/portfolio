- use icons in icons/finder_sidebar - DONE

- add a stickies-like note that welcomes users to my portfolio - add an image of me.
- add "About me" which should go over my life, background, media tastes, hobbies, beliefs, etc. with accompanying pictures - use img/
- add "Education" which should show a summary of my BTech and masters (with accompanying pics in img/ too) - use AI to generate summaries of my strongest performances using my transcripts
- add a context menu for the apple logo on the top left - with "About me", "This portfolio's source code"
- add descriptions to all files/links/etc. on Finder and display this desc on the details side panel
- add a 1-second mock login screen at the start (and maybe a welcome message?) with my name & face.

keep search-bar functionality in mind when implementing everything below:

- recreate either preview or something else for viewing resume (DONE - but very basic, doesn't fully simulate Preview), education background, projects (start with dummy projects) and tech stack -- interlink tech stack and projects.
- figure out a way to dynamically generate the data for "projects" component - pull info/data from my GitHub repos to automate this maybe. BONUS; figure out a way to dynamically fetch/generate appropriate mac-style icons for each project.

advanced:
- use github apis or smth to update last modified datetime of each project regularly
