- use icons in icons/finder_sidebar - DONE
- add a stickies-like note that welcomes users to my portfolio - add an image of me - DONE.
- add a context menu for the apple logo on the top left - with "About me", "This portfolio's source code"

- on firefox & zen browser, wallpapers dont fade in and out on changing - the new wallpaper appears first and then there's an instantaneous return and fade-out transition of the old wallpaper, but on brave (chromium) it works as intended. fix this.
- add desktop icons - projects folder, resume, about me
- add "tech stack" section - figure out a clever way to present this
- add "Education" which should show a summary of my BTech and masters (with accompanying pics in img/ too) - use AI to generate summaries of my strongest performances using my transcripts
- add "About me" which should go over my life, background, media tastes, hobbies, beliefs, etc. with accompanying pictures - use img/
- add descriptions to all files/links/etc. on Finder and display this desc on the details side panel
- add a 1-second mock login screen at the start (and maybe a welcome message?) with my name & face.
- in control center allow changing wallpapers
- add acknowledgements and thank the creators of icons, mention where i found them, etc.
- control center menu's z-index should be higher than the toast
- control center > change wallpaper needs refinements - make the whole inner submenu darker or indented - to indicate it's a submenu under "Change Wallpaper", add arrows to indicate drop down status, darken current wallpaper in the drop down and add a checkmark; when hovering over a wallpaper thumbnail, show the wallpaper name as a tooltip
- double touch-clicking inside finder doesn't work on tablets + finder window is too tall on tablets
- to the menu bar add a Give Feedback option which allows users to suggest new features, report bugs, etc.

keep search-bar functionality in mind when implementing everything below:

- recreate either preview or something else for viewing resume (DONE - but very basic, doesn't fully simulate Preview), education background, projects (start with dummy projects) and tech stack -- interlink tech stack and projects.
- figure out a way to dynamically generate the data for "projects" component - pull info/data from my GitHub repos to automate this maybe. BONUS; figure out a way to dynamically fetch/generate appropriate mac-style icons for each project.
- in smartphone mode the finder isn't working properly; double clicking won't open anything. fix this

advanced:
- use github apis or smth to update last modified datetime of each project regularly
