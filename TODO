- in control center allow changing wallpapers - DONE
- on firefox & zen browser, wallpapers dont fade in and out on changing - the new wallpaper appears first and then there's an instantaneous return and fade-out transition of the old wallpaper, but on brave (chromium) it works as intended. fix this. - DONE
- control center > change wallpaper needs refinements - make the whole inner submenu darker or indented - to indicate it's a submenu under "Change Wallpaper", add arrows to indicate drop down status, darken current wallpaper in the drop down and add a checkmark; when hovering over a wallpaper thumbnail, show the wallpaper name as a tooltip - DONE
- double touch-clicking inside finder doesn't work on tablets + finder window is too tall on tablets - DONE
- add desktop icons - projects folder, resume - DONE
- in smartphone mode the finder isn't working properly; double clicking won't open anything. fix this - DONE but still doesn't work on tablets and landscape mode - DONE
- recreate the "About this mac" window for "About Me" - DONE (Generic InfoView implemented)
- second sticky on phones is not directly below the first - fix it so that it's directly below the first sticky always - even if i change the height of the first one - DONE
- move resume icon on desktop to a more obvious location on phones - it's hidden behind the sticky (make sticky thinner?) - DONE
- add an easily visible "download" option for resume on small screens/touch screens - DONE for all screens all PDFs

- add "tech stack" section - consider using InfoView or a specialized grid view
- add "Education" which should show a summary of my BTech and masters (with accompanying pics in img/ too) - use AI to generate summaries of my strongest performances using my transcripts
- add "My Life in Pictures" which should go over my life, background, media tastes, hobbies, beliefs, etc. with accompanying pictures - use img/
- replace the buttons in about me with tech stack, education and my life in pictures when they're ready
- add descriptions to all files/links/etc. on Finder and display this desc on the details side panel
- add a 1-second mock login screen at the start (and maybe a welcome message?) with my name & face.
- add acknowledgements and thank the creators of icons, mention where i found them, etc.
- to the menu bar add a Give Feedback option which allows users to suggest new features, report bugs, etc. - figure out a way to automate going from here to making an issue on the repo's issues page (or an alternative way for me to receive feedback from this static gh-pages site)
- make windows draggable on touchscreen devices

keep search-bar functionality in mind when implementing everything below:

- recreate either preview or something else for viewing resume (DONE - but very basic, doesn't fully simulate Preview), education background, projects (DONE but hardcoded) and tech stack -- interlink tech stack and projects.
- figure out a way to dynamically generate the data for "projects" component - pull info/data from my GitHub repos to automate this maybe
    - also fetch last modified dates using latest commits.
    - this could be a separate executable/script that i need to run locally to generate/update/delete static JSON files or similar - since gh-pages will be static. OR explore github actions for this.
    - BONUS; figure out a way to dynamically fetch/generate appropriate mac-style icons for each project.
- add spotlight search with shortcut once search is implemented
